Flask is a Python web framework based on Werkzeug and Jinja 2. Flask help you build web apps very easy and in afew simple steps. Getting started with flask 
is very easy because there isn't much coding to be done here to create a basic web app. So let's get started. You can find the official documentation [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/)

First we need to install Flask. If you're on Ubuntu, the following command will install Flask.

{: .box-note}
$ sudo pip install Flask

Now that you've installed flask let's build out first web app.

~~~
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
~~~
Write the following line of code in a file called **application.py**

Now to run the file type the following into a terminal

~~~
$ export FLASK_APP=application.py
$ flask run
