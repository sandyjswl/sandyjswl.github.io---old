Finance is a stock trading website via which users can buy and sell stocks of a
company as per the current share prices of the company. The website also includes a database which stores the details of the users such that the user can sign in at a later stage using the same credentials.

When a new user creates an account, he is credited with $10,000 so that he can buy stocks of the companies of preference. Smart purchases will help the user increase his balance. If the user is short of money, he can also take a loan provided the amount is less than $1000.
Below are the screenshots of different pages included.

**Tools used**
